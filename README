Rollout is a system developed to automate system administration on UNIX servers.
It is primarily focused towards Linux, but could be adapted to Solaris, HP-UX,
AIX, etc.

It is written purely in Perl, and the configuration is also a Perl source file.
Some Perl knowledge is required to edit the configuration, but copy-and-paste
may suffice.

System Administration can generally be reduced to a set of steps, which must be
completed in order.  Some example steps include:

   * Copy files, create symlinks
   * Edit configuration files
   * Start / stop services
   * Add / modify users & groups
   * Install applications

The idea behind Rollout is to automate all these steps in a configurable way.
Rollout is by design idempotent - it can be run many times on a single server
and produce the same results.

There are examples in the docs directory.
